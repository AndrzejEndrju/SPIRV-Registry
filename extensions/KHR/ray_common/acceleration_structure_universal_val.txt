Change the second bullet under "Any pointer operand to an *OpFunctionCall* must be"
to include *OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR*:

 * a pointer to an element in an array that is a memory object declaration,
   where the element type is *OpTypeSampler*, *OpTypeImage*, or
   *OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR*.

Add a new bullet under "Data rules":

 * Instructions accessing a scalar acceleration structure out of a composite
   must only use _dynamically-uniform_ indexes, unless the index is decorated with
   *NonUniformEXT*. They must be in the same block in which their _Result <id>_
   are consumed. Such _Result <id>_ must not appear as operands to *OpPhi* or
   *OpSelect* instructions, or any instructions other than the ray tracing
   instructions specified to operate on them.
